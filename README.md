# FinSight
**FinSight** is a personal finance app built to answer one simple question:

> **Do I actually know where my money goes?**

Most people don’t lack discipline. They lack clarity.

FinSight helps you build that clarity through **manual tracking with strong visual feedback**, designed for real daily use rather than financial theory or bank-driven automation.

## What FinSight Is
FinSight is a lightweight, mobile-friendly personal finance tracker that focuses on:

* Understanding spending patterns
* Seeing balance changes over time
* Building awareness through consistent, intentional tracking

It is built for people who want control and transparency, without connecting bank accounts or dealing with complex financial tooling.

## What You Can Do With It
* Track income, expenses, and transfers
* Organize spending with custom categories
* View monthly and daily balance trends
* Understand where money accumulates or leaks
* Use the app comfortably on desktop and mobile

The system is designed to be **fast, clear, and opinionated**, prioritizing insight over feature overload.

## Why Manual Tracking
Automatic tools often hide what matters.

By entering transactions yourself:

* You stay aware of spending decisions
* Patterns become obvious faster
* Financial habits improve naturally

FinSight supports this approach with a UI optimized for **low friction and frequent use**.

## Philosophy
FinSight is intentionally:

* Simple over complex
* Explicit over automated
* Insight-driven over data-heavy

The goal is not to manage money for you.
The goal is to help you **see it clearly**.
